If you find any error or need support please raise a issue. If you think you can add a feature, or help solve a bug please raise a PR


**This repo welcomes any kind of contributions :pray:**



* If you'd like to make a pull request to contribute, please keep it simple. If you use some higher level techniques I don't understand, I'm not going to approve it because I won't be able to maintain it.

* Please don't make a pull request with a bunch of changes in syntax just for the sake of 'best practices' (ex: changing "if blah == False" to "if not blah"). Unless something makes a difference to performance frankly I don't care.

* Avoid adding new non-standard libraries if at all possible. If you have an idea that would require one, please suggest it as an issue first instead of going through all the work and submitting a pull request.

* MAKE SURE IT RUNS
